# The-Word-s-City

> This script takes some documents in text files, performs a brief analysis of their content, and creates objects based on the words. It connects these words according to the order in which they appear in the text, forming an object similar to a map, where the paths are shaped by the document's original text. The positions of the words are adjusted during the animation through a force-based system considering the connections between them.

## 📚 About the Project

This project was developed as part of the Computational Laboratory for Design course within the Design and Multimedia program at the University of Coimbra.  
It was built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**, without any external dependencies, to convert text files into an object visually resembling a city map formed by text.

## 🚀 Features

- Displays the map generated from the text, alongside the original text.
- Allows switching between different available text documents and viewing their respective results.
- Enables play and pause of the animation between words.
- Allows repositioning words into a new set of positions.
